# vid2img

A video to image extrator converted from Atcold's original version of MATLAB.

## Annotation

`vid2img` runs with assigned videos saved in `Videos` folder.
Videos should be saved in corresponding categories.
It can be run as follows.

```bash
cd Codes
qlua vid2img.lua
```

After images have been annotated with `vid2img`, patches can be extracted with `crop`.

```bash
th crop.lua
```

For a list of available parameters, run `th crop.lua --help`.
